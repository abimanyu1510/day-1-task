//Q2:Write a blog about objects and it's internal representation in JavaScript?

An object is a collection of related data (or)funtionality.These usually consist of several variables and functions.
Objects is a "reference data type".
It is most important data-type and forms the "building blocks" for modern JavaScript.
These objects are quite different from JavaScript primitive data-types(Numbers,String,Boolean,undefined and Symbols).
Properties of javascript objects can also accessed or set using the bracket notation.
Objects are sometimes called associative arrays ,Since each property is associated with string value that can be used to access it.
